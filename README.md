# Bookmark Refresh

> Update your bookmarks

Lets you update your bookmarks, specifically your bookmark titles. It loads each bookmark location, picks the `<title/>`, and updates the bookmark. Useful when used with the [append website description](#append-website-description) option. Tested on Chrome and Firefox:

For example, this bookmark location:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>GoatGoatYo</title>
  <meta name="description" content="GoatGoatYo is the search engine that
  tracks you. We don't protect your search history from anyone ‚Äì even us!">
</head>

<body>...</body>

</html>
```

Will have its title set to: _GoatGoatYo_.

## Options

### Append website description

When set, the above becomes: _GoatGoatYo (GoatGoatYo is the search engine that tracks you. We don't protect your search history from anyone ‚Äì even us!)_. If you use the address bar to lookup bookmarks, typing **search engine** will also suggest **GoatGoatYo**. üêê
